## Key Features

- **Layered Data Organization:** Clear separation of raw (Bronze), refined (Silver), and business-ready (Gold) data layers.
- **Data Governance:**  Strong data quality rules, lineage tracking, and access controls using Microsoft Purview and Azure Active Directory.
- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Role-based permissions for Data Engineers and Data Analysts, ensuring secure data access.
- **Data Pipelines:** Automated workflows for data ingestion, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Microsoft Fabric Dataflows.
- **Data Modeling:** Well-structured data models in the Gold layer for optimal analysis and reporting.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Seamless integration with Power BI for data visualization and analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - Microsoft Fabric subscription
    - Azure Active Directory (AAD) setup
    - Microsoft Purview (optional, but recommended)
2. **Clone Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    ```
3. **Setup Microsoft Fabric Environment:**
    - Create a workspace.
    - Configure data sources and connections.
4. **Deploy Data Pipelines:**
    - Use the provided Dataflows to automate data processing.
    - Customize transformations as needed.
5. **Configure Data Governance:**
    - Set up data classification and sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview.
    - Define access policies in AAD.
6. **Build Reports:**
    - Connect Power BI to the Gold layer.
    - Create insightful reports and dashboards.

## Usage

- **Data Engineers:**  Focus on data ingestion, transformation, and pipeline maintenance.
- **Data Analysts:** Analyze data in the Gold layer to generate reports and insights.
